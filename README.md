# VolunteerProfiler

## In this project the idea was to help the team leaders of a student organization(Hult Prize Ui branch) shortlist volunteers for an interview process faster. I also realised that the team leaders would need a template to view the information of the candidates easily. 

## With that in mind I implemented a word template using Mailmerge. Python was the language used in this project, to make this work I used MailMerge to parse data from the spreadsheet containing the candidates response into the Template.

## Libraries used for data cleaning:

## 1. Pandas
## 2. MailMerge

## Limitation of current code
 ## 1. As of now this code base can only parse 1 record at a time from the spreadsheet and store it on 1 page in the word template. I am currently working on fixing this limitation.
 ## 2. Sensitive informations in the datasets were encoded.
